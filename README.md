## This is Prometheus, a Drupal starter kit.
Prometheus includes a simple, responsive theme, also called Prometheus. This theme handles some basic things and is meant to be extended, hacked and generally modified to suit a given project. It also includes basic configuration for a Drupal 7 website. That means it has a configured WYSIWYG, a few commonly used views, sample content and more. This starter kit is a constant work in progress.

To install Prometheus, download or clone this repository. You'll also need the database, which is found in the _db folder. You should delete this folder and the associated auto backup when using this starter kit on your projects. You can cancel the backup job on the Backup and Migrate configuration page.

Once you have imported the database and reset the db connection information in settings.php, the site should be ready to work with. The username and password are both 'demo'.
